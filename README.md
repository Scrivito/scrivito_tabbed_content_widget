# ScrivitoTabbedContentWidget

This gem adds a Scrivito widget for tabbed content to your page.

## Prerequists

This widget requires Bootstrap.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'scrivito_tabbed_content_widget'

## Customization

This widget includes an attribute for the background color of every tab. The value of this attribute is used as a CSS class. If you want to use this feature, add a CSS rule for your selectable colors:

```css
.bg-red {
  background-color: red;
}
```

You can also use the [Scrivito Advanced Editors](https://github.com/Scrivito/scrivito_advanced_editors #color_picker) color picker to have a better visualization of the selectable color classes.
